## Spinning Cube

A single project to rotate a cube using modern OpenGL in C++, based on the *Interactive Computer Graphics A Top-Down Approach with OpenGL* book written by Edward Angel and Dave Shreiner (6th edition, 2012). 

The required [headers] can be found on the page of authors. Also, Ed Angel is a very famous professor in Computer Graphics (University of New Mexico).

Code uses a bypass shaders (vertex and fragment), just to see a cube spinning.
